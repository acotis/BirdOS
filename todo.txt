+ Write memory manager
  First idea: Keep a doubly linked list of available memory chunks. To
  	      allocate memory, scroll through the list until you find a chunk
	      that's big enough and break off the amount requested. To free
	      memory, scroll through the list until you find the place it
	      belongs. If it's adjacent to the chunks on either side of it,
	      merge them together.
