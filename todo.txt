+ Get keyboard input working

+ Write memory manager
  First idea: Keep a doubly linked list of available memory chunks. To
  	      allocate memory, scroll through the list until you find a chunk
	      that's big enough and break off the amount requested. To free
	      memory, scroll through the list until you find the place it
	      belongs. If it's adjacent to the chunks on either side of it,
	      merge them together.
  	      
+ Determine the copyright of the bird image.

+ Add signed versions of uint_to_str[_cbase]

+ Perform comprehensive test of [u]int_to_str[_cbase]

+ Move the graphing code in circle.s to a new math_demo.s, then implement
  a real circle.

+ Change implementation of cosine to be a Mclaurin series? (In the current
  implementation, very small values will be swamped by the addition of
  pi/2 due to floating-point mechanics.)
