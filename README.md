## BirdOS

This is a pet project of mine where I'm trying to implement a fully-functional, keyboard-based OS on a Raspberry Pi, using only ARM assembly. Once I get around to writing a compiler in assembly, I will allow myself to write in the language it compiles (but only using my own compiler to do it, of course!).

## Current status

This project is in its infancy. I'm only putting it on here so that I don't lose all my work if my laptop gets borked.
